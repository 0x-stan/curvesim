## Simple Summary
Provide a simple explanation of the feature, the "what" not the "why".


## Motivation / Use-case
Explain the problem this solves or why it would improve Curvesim.  You should make clear why
existing functionality is inadequate for your needs and the feature is needed.


## Detailed Summary
Describe the exact changes you wish to be implemented.  There should be enough details so Curvesim developers understand what is being asked and can proceed with adding the proposed feature.


## Backwards Compatibility
If this feature is backwards incompatible, i.e. breaks existing design or functionality, you should explain the breakages.

If there are no incompatibilities, you can skip this section.
